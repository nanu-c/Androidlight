Android Artnet Application

This is a basic Android application to create a free ArtNet Android app.

It is still pre-Alpha, so be patient.

It's based on:
[artnet4j-elios] (https://github.com/Eliosoft/artnet4j-elios)
which is a fork of original artnet4j lib developped by Karsten Schmidt and hosted [here.] (http://code.google.com/p/artnet4j/)
>"Art-Net by Artistic Licence allows for broadcasting DMX data via IP/UDP.
 This library is implementing the basic protocol for Java applications."

The modifications to run jaxb on android are described by this [blog post]
(http://www.docx4java.org/blog/2012/05/jaxb-can-be-made-to-run-on-android/)

and the libraries are found there:
